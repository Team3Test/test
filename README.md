“Write a poem about a sunrise.” I asked three AI chatbots—OpenAI’s ChatGPT-4, Google’s Bard, and Anthropic’s Claude—and myself—an 8th grade human. I then surveyed a panel of 38 AI experts and 39 English experts to judge the results. Is AI smarter than an 8th grader?

And the survey says…AI is not smarter than an 8th grader, at least not yet. The 8th grader won 1st place, and by a higher margin when judged by English experts. Bard, ChatGPT-4, and Claude came in 2nd, 3rd, and 4th places, respectively, both in writing quality and their ability to fool the judges into believing they were authored by a human. Most strikingly, English experts were far better at discerning which poems were written by AI, with 11 English experts vs. only 3 AI experts guessing the author (human vs. AI) of all four poems correctly. This points to a need for English experts to play a greater role in helping shape future versions of AI technology.

With the explosive popularity of large language models (LLMs), much has been written about AI claiming the roles of human writers, and with that the loss of authentic human creativity. Personally, I’ve been working on a creative writing project — a collection of short fiction pieces and poetry, a few of which I have submitted for publication.
